# Sheepypad
open source Macropad for art, gaming... whatever you want, man.


## ok but what is it 
this is a repo containing a fairly rudimentary macropad schematic and accompanying circuitpython code. 

the supplied macropad contains:
- 1x mode switching tactile switch
- 2x rotary encoders
- 1x 5-way switch
- 9x mechanical keyswitches
- 1x 128x32 SSD1306 OLED
- 1x Rasberry Pi Pico (or other pin-out compatible rp2040 board) 

I have written firmware to make it fairly simple to create and modify profiles for this pad. 
I intend to use it with art programs and flight sim.


## why was this made
I wanted to dip my toes into circuit design with a project I felt I could actually benefit from. this was the result. 
if you've ever wanted a super basic example project for making a HID device in circuitpython, this may be useful to you too!
